However, the project always struggled with errors in the firmware. In particular, the problem with heating up in dual mode could only be improved with a workaround, but not eliminated.
For the perfect operation of the Weedo X40 with Ultimaker Cura, the X40 PRO project with the adaptation of the firmware to Ultimaker Cura.
